# Ethical Hacking

## 📚 Introduction

**Ethical Hacking**, also known as **penetration testing** or **white-hat hacking**, refers to the authorized and legal process of testing and evaluating the security of a system, network, or application to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious hackers.

Ethical hackers help organizations strengthen their security by finding and fixing security issues before bad actors can exploit them.
