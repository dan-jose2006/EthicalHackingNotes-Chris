# 🛡 Ethical Hacking Notes

## 🔓 Password Cracking

*Password Cracking* is the process of recovering passwords from stored or transmitted data using various techniques.

### 🛠 Techniques:
- *Brute Force Attack* – Trying every possible combination.
- *Dictionary Attack* – Using a list of likely passwords.
- *Rainbow Tables* – Precomputed tables of hash values.
- *Phishing* – Tricking users into giving passwords.
- *Keyloggers* – Software/hardware to capture keystrokes.

### 💡 Prevention:
- Strong passwords (mix of letters, numbers, symbols)
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Avoid common or reused passwords

## 🌐 Types of Networks

1. *LAN (Local Area Network)* – Home or office.
2. *WAN (Wide Area Network)* – Internet.
3. *MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)* – City-wide.
4. *PAN (Personal Area Network)* – Bluetooth devices.
5. *WLAN (Wireless LAN)* – Wi-Fi networks.
6. *CAN (Campus Area Network)* – University or large organization.

## 🔁 UDP vs TCP

| Feature | TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) | UDP (User Datagram Protocol) |
|--------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Connection | Connection-oriented | Connectionless |
| Reliability | Reliable (guarantees delivery) | Unreliable (no guarantee) |
| Speed | Slower | Faster |
| Use Case | Email, Web, File Transfer | Streaming, VoIP, Gaming |
| Flow Control | Yes | No |
| Error Checking | Yes | Minimal |

## 🧮 Subnet

A *Subnet* is a segmented piece of a larger network. It helps manage IP addresses and isolate traffic for performance or security.

- Example: 192.168.1.0/24  
- The /24 indicates the subnet mask (255.255.255.0)

### Benefits:
- Organized IP allocation
- Reduced congestion
- Enhanced security

## 📣 Internet Broadcast

*Internet Broadcast* is when one sender transmits data to all hosts in a network.

- Common address: 255.255.255.255 (IPv4)
- Used in protocols like *ARP* or *DHCP*
- Typically restricted to local networks

## 🌐 IP Address

### IPv4 vs IPv6

| Feature | IPv4 | IPv6 |
|--------|------|------|
| Bit Length | 32-bit | 128-bit |
| Format | Decimal (192.168.0.1) | Hexadecimal (2001:db8::1) |
| Addresses | ~4.3 billion | Virtually unlimited |
| Header | Simple | Complex |
| Security | Optional | Built-in IPSec |
| Status | Still common | Growing use

---

## 📤 Transfer Protocol

A *Transfer Protocol* defines rules for data transmission between devices.

### Common Examples:
- *HTTP / HTTPS* – Web traffic
- *FTP / SFTP* – File transfers
- *SMTP / POP3 / IMAP* – Email protocols
- *SSH* – Secure remote access
- *Telnet* – Remote login (not secure)

## 🔐 [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

*Have I Been Pwned* is a website where you can check if your email or password has appeared in any known data breaches.

### Features:
- Check if your *email or phone* has been leaked.
- Verify if your *passwords* have been exposed.
- Get breach *alerts* by subscribing with your email.
- Useful for both individuals and organizations.

### Why It's Important:
- Raises awareness of leaked personal data.
- Encourages better password practices.
- Helps companies monitor security exposure.

> If listed in a breach: change passwords immediately and enable 2FA.
