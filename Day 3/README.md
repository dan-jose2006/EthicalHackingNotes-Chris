üí£ Villain Framework (by KeralaHacker)
Villain is a post-exploitation framework used by ethical hackers for compromising Windows systems and setting up reverse shells in penetration tests. It supports multi-client reverse shells over HTTP, HTTPS, or WebSockets.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps
Clone the repository from GitHub:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/keralahacker/Villain.git
This command downloads the Villain framework to your system.

git must be pre-installed.

Navigate to the Villain directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd Villain
ls
cd Villain enters the folder.

ls confirms files like villain.py and requirements.txt are present.

Install Python requirements:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
This installs all Python libraries needed to run Villain.

--break-system-packages bypasses pip restrictions on system-wide installs (used in environments like Kali Linux).

If Crypto Library is Missing (Fix Error):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip3 install Crypto --break-system-packages
Crypto is sometimes missing, and Villain won‚Äôt run without it.

Run Villain:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 villain.py
This starts the framework.

You‚Äôll see the Villain dashboard or listener setup options.
